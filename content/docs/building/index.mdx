# Building & Installation

AudioCheckr is written in Rust and can be built on Linux, macOS, and Windows. This guide covers all installation methods.

## Quick Install (From Source)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abalajiksh/audiocheckr
cd audiocheckr

# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Binary is at ./target/release/audiocheckr
```

## Prerequisites

### Rust Toolchain

AudioCheckr requires Rust 1.70 or later. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
# Install rustup (Linux/macOS)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Follow the prompts, then reload your shell
source ~/.cargo/env

# Verify installation
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

On Windows, download the installer from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### System Dependencies

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    libasound2-dev
```

#### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    gcc \
    pkg-config \
    alsa-lib-devel
```

#### Linux (Arch)

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel alsa-lib
```

#### macOS

Xcode command line tools are required:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Windows

Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

## Building from Source

### Standard Build

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/abalajiksh/audiocheckr
cd audiocheckr

# Build in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# The binary is located at:
# Linux/macOS: ./target/release/audiocheckr
# Windows: ./target/release/audiocheckr.exe
```

### Install to System Path

```bash
# Install to ~/.cargo/bin/ (should be in your PATH)
cargo install --path .

# Verify installation
audiocheckr --version
```

### Development Build

For faster compilation during development (unoptimized):

```bash
cargo build

# Binary at ./target/debug/audiocheckr
```

## Cross-Compilation

### Building for ARM64 (aarch64)

For Raspberry Pi 4, Apple Silicon, or other ARM64 systems:

```bash
# Install target
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Install cross-compiler (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

# Build
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
export CC_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc

cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Binary at ./target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/audiocheckr
```

### Building for Windows on Linux

```bash
# Install target
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Install cross-compiler
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

# Build
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Binary at ./target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/audiocheckr.exe
```

## Build Configuration

### Cargo.toml Options

AudioCheckr's release profile is optimized for performance:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true          # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1   # Single codegen unit for better optimization
opt-level = 3       # Maximum optimization
```

### Feature Flags

Currently, AudioCheckr has no optional features. All functionality is included in the default build.

## Verifying Your Build

After building, verify the installation:

```bash
# Check version
./target/release/audiocheckr --version

# Show help
./target/release/audiocheckr --help

# Quick test (analyze current directory)
./target/release/audiocheckr -i . --json
```

## Troubleshooting

### "cargo not found"

Ensure Rust is properly installed and `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Linking Errors on Linux

Missing development libraries. Install ALSA development files:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel
```

### Slow Compilation

First build downloads and compiles all dependencies (~2-5 minutes). Subsequent builds are faster.

For faster iteration during development:
```bash
# Use debug builds for testing
cargo build
cargo run -- -i file.flac
```

### Out of Memory During Build

LTO (Link-Time Optimization) uses significant memory. On systems with limited RAM:

```bash
# Build without LTO (faster, slightly larger binary)
cargo build --release --config profile.release.lto=false
```

## Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for common platforms are available from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/abalajiksh/audiocheckr/releases) page:

| Platform | Architecture | File |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Linux | x86_64 | `audiocheckr-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux | ARM64 | `audiocheckr-linux-aarch64` |
| macOS | x86_64 | `audiocheckr-darwin-x86_64` |
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | `audiocheckr-darwin-aarch64` |
| Windows | x86_64 | `audiocheckr-windows-x86_64.exe` |

### Using Pre-Built Binaries

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x audiocheckr-linux-x86_64
./audiocheckr-linux-x86_64 --version

# Optionally move to PATH
sudo mv audiocheckr-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/audiocheckr
```

## Docker

A Docker image is available for containerized usage:

```dockerfile
FROM rust:1.75 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libasound2 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/audiocheckr /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["audiocheckr"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t audiocheckr .

# Analyze files (mount your music directory)
docker run -v /path/to/music:/music audiocheckr -i /music
```

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd audiocheckr

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Rebuild
cargo build --release

# Or reinstall
cargo install --path . --force
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
# If installed via cargo install
cargo uninstall audiocheckr

# If manually copied
rm /usr/local/bin/audiocheckr

# Remove build artifacts
rm -rf target/
```

## System Requirements

| CPU | Any x86_64 or ARM64 |
| RAM | 256 MB available |
| Disk | 50 MB for binary |
| OS | Linux, macOS 10.15+, Windows 10+ |

### Recommended for Large Libraries

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| CPU | Multi-core (parallel analysis) |
| RAM | 1 GB+ for spectrogram generation |
| Disk | SSD for faster file access |

### Performance Notes

- Typical analysis: 2-5 seconds per file
- Phase analysis adds ~1-2 seconds
- Spectrogram generation adds ~1-3 seconds
- Memory usage: ~100 MB for typical 5-minute track
