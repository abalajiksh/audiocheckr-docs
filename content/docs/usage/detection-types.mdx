# Detection Types

AudioCheckr uses multiple analysis techniques to identify various types of audio quality issues. This page explains each type of defect and how to interpret the findings.

## Lossy Transcodes

When a lossy file (MP3, AAC, etc.) is converted to a lossless format (FLAC, WAV), the original compression artifacts remain. AudioCheckr detects these "fake lossless" files.

### MP3 Transcode

**What it means:** The file was likely encoded from an MP3 source.

**How it's detected:**
- Frequency cutoff analysis (MP3 removes high frequencies)
- Brick-wall filter detection (sharp frequency cutoff)
- Codec signature matching

**Typical cutoff frequencies:**

| Bitrate | Approximate Cutoff |
|---------|-------------------|
| 64 kbps | 11-12 kHz |
| 128 kbps | 15.5-16.5 kHz |
| 192 kbps | 18.5-19 kHz |
| 256 kbps | 19.5-20 kHz |
| 320 kbps | 20-20.5 kHz |

**Example output:**
```
✗ MP3 transcode (~128kbps) - cutoff at 16000 Hz (85% confidence)
  - Sharp rolloff detected at 16kHz
  - Brick-wall filter characteristic of MP3 encoding
```

### AAC Transcode

**What it means:** The file was likely encoded from an AAC (M4A) source.

**How it's detected:**
- Frequency shelf pattern (AAC has different rolloff characteristics)
- Spectral signature matching

**Typical cutoff frequencies:**

| Bitrate | Approximate Cutoff |
|---------|-------------------|
| 128 kbps | 16-17 kHz |
| 256 kbps | 19-20 kHz |

### Opus Transcode

**What it means:** The file was likely encoded from Opus source.

**How it's detected:**
- Opus has distinctive spectral characteristics
- Cutoff patterns differ from other codecs

**Typical cutoff frequencies:**

| Bitrate | Approximate Cutoff |
|---------|-------------------|
| 64 kbps | 12-13 kHz |
| 128 kbps | ~20 kHz (full bandwidth) |

### Ogg Vorbis Transcode

**What it means:** The file was likely encoded from Ogg Vorbis source.

**How it's detected:**
- Quality-level dependent cutoff frequencies
- Spectral signature matching

**Typical cutoff frequencies:**

| Quality | Approximate Cutoff |
|---------|-------------------|
| Q3 (~112 kbps) | 16-17 kHz |
| Q7 (~224 kbps) | 19-20 kHz |

## Bit Depth Issues

### Bit Depth Mismatch

**What it means:** The file claims to be 24-bit but actually contains 16-bit audio with zero-padded lower bits.

**How it's detected:**
AudioCheckr uses four independent methods:

1. **LSB Precision Analysis** - Examines trailing zeros in sample values
2. **Histogram Analysis** - Counts unique values at different quantization levels
3. **Quantization Noise Analysis** - Measures noise floor characteristics
4. **Value Clustering Analysis** - Checks if values cluster on 256-multiples

**Example output:**
```
✗ Bit depth mismatch: claims 24-bit, actually 16-bit (92% confidence)
  - LSB analysis: 16 bit (confidence: 95.0%)
  - Histogram analysis: 16 bit (confidence: 90.0%)
  - Noise floor analysis: 16 bit (confidence: 88.0%)
  - Clustering analysis: 16 bit (confidence: 94.0%)
```

**Why this matters:**
- 16-bit audio has ~96 dB dynamic range
- 24-bit audio has ~144 dB dynamic range
- "Fake" 24-bit files waste storage space without quality benefit

## Upsampling

### Upsampled Audio

**What it means:** The audio was upsampled from a lower sample rate (e.g., 44.1kHz → 96kHz).

**How it's detected:**
- Spectral null detection at original Nyquist frequency
- Energy patterns above original sample rate's frequency limit
- Inter-sample peak analysis

**Example output:**
```
✗ Upsampled from 44100 Hz to 96000 Hz (78% confidence)
  - Spectral null detected at 22050 Hz (original Nyquist)
  - No genuine high-frequency content above 22kHz
```

**Why this matters:**
- Upsampling cannot add information that wasn't in the original
- High-resolution sample rates (88.2kHz, 96kHz, etc.) are only beneficial if the source was recorded at those rates

**Understanding sample rates:**

| Sample Rate | Nyquist Frequency | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| 44.1 kHz | 22.05 kHz | CD quality |
| 48 kHz | 24 kHz | Video/broadcast |
| 88.2 kHz | 44.1 kHz | High-res (2x CD) |
| 96 kHz | 48 kHz | High-res audio |
| 176.4 kHz | 88.2 kHz | Ultra high-res |
| 192 kHz | 96 kHz | Studio master |

## Codec Artifacts

### Pre-Echo

**What it means:** Transform codec artifacts appearing before transients (drum hits, etc.).

**How it's detected:**
- Transient detection via envelope following
- Energy analysis before detected transients
- MDCT window pattern detection

**Example output:**
```
✗ Pre-echo artifacts (score: 0.45) (67% confidence)
  - 12/28 transients show pre-echo
  - Average pre-echo level: -24 dB relative to transient
```

**Why this matters:**
Pre-echo is a characteristic artifact of transform codecs (MP3, AAC, Vorbis) and indicates lossy compression was applied.

### Joint Stereo

**What it means:** Lossy joint stereo encoding was detected.

**How it's detected:**
- Channel correlation analysis
- Mid-side energy ratio
- High-frequency stereo reduction

**Example output:**
```
✗ Joint stereo encoding detected (72% confidence)
  - Channel correlation: 0.97
  - Stereo width reduced above 10kHz
```

### Phase Discontinuities

**What it means:** Codec frame boundary artifacts detected.

**How it's detected:**
- Phase coherence analysis between consecutive frames
- Frame boundary discontinuity scoring

## Other Issues

### Clipping

**What it means:** Samples at or above full scale (0 dBFS).

**Example output:**
```
✗ Clipping detected (0.02% of samples) (95% confidence)
```

### Inter-Sample Overs

**What it means:** True peak exceeds 0 dBFS between sample points.

**How it's detected:**
- 4x oversampling via sinc interpolation
- ITU-R BS.1770 compliant measurement

**Example output:**
```
✗ 23 inter-sample overs (max: +1.2 dB) (88% confidence)
```

### Spectral Artifacts

**What it means:** Unusual spectral patterns detected (notches, anomalies).

## Confidence Levels

Each detection includes a confidence percentage:

| Confidence | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| 90-100% | Very high confidence - almost certainly correct |
| 70-90% | High confidence - very likely correct |
| 50-70% | Moderate confidence - probably correct but verify |
| Below 50% | Low confidence - may be false positive |

Multiple detectors finding the same issue increases overall confidence.

## False Positives

Some scenarios may trigger false positives:

### Legitimate Sharp Cutoffs
- Some professional masters have intentional high-frequency filtering
- Electronic music may have synthesized content with sharp cutoffs
- **Solution:** Use `--profile electronic` for electronic music

### Band-Limited Recordings
- Older recordings may have natural frequency limitations
- Some microphones have limited frequency response
- **Solution:** Consider the source material age and type

### Unusual Production Techniques
- Heavy compression or limiting
- Extreme EQ settings
- Creative effects processing
- **Solution:** Use `--show-suppressed` to see what was filtered

### Tips for Verification

1. **Generate a spectrogram** - Visual inspection often clarifies ambiguous cases
2. **Check multiple files** - If only one file in an album is flagged, investigate
3. **Use verbose mode** - See which specific detectors triggered
4. **Adjust profile** - Match the profile to the genre
