# Upsampling Detection

## The Problem

44.1kHz upsampled to 96kHz has no content above 22.05kHz.

## Detection Methods

1. **Spectral Null** - Energy void above original Nyquist
2. **Inter-Sample Peaks** - Genuine high-res has 60-75% inter-sample peaks

| Audio Type | Inter-Sample Ratio |
|------------|-------------------|
| Genuine 96kHz | 60-75% |
| Upsampled | 20-35% |
